# Streamdata.io API Gallery - Department of Homeland Security Profiling
This is a repository for managing the profiling of Department of Homeland Security. Right now, it is just a Github repository, README, and an [APIs.json](apis.md) outlining some of the details of Department of Homeland Security, including different links and artificats defining their operation.

Eventually, this repository will possess as much information about this entity as possible, and if it has an API, it will also possess OpenAPI definitions, and Postman Collections defining the surface area of the API. Each entry in the Streamdata.io API Gallery begins with a Github repository, then an APIs.json, and then OpenAPIs and Postman Collections when relevant.

Once there is an OpenAPI for Department of Homeland Security, it will be available within the [Streamdata.io API Gallery](http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/), until then the companies profile will be used in a variety of other sites and applications.

You can visit the gallery at: http://api.gallery.streamdata.io/

Feel free to submit a pull request with any changes to the API.json, as well as any added OpenAPI, or Postman Collections -- you can also leave any issues via the Github Issues for this repository.
